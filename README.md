# Summary of the United States (SOTUS) conformant to the International Patient Summary (IPS) FHIR Implementation Guide

This is an unapproved experiment in what a summary of the United States could look like. This is not work approved by US ASTP/ONC or HL7, so it should be considered only an idea for future consideration at this time. This would be a FHIR clinical document to serve as a successor to US C-CDA conformant Continuity of Care Documents (see https://hl7.org/cda/us/ccda/).
